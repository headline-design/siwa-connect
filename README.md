## Security Considerations

When implementing the SIWA process, consider the following security best practices:

- Use HTTPS to secure the communication between the client and server.
- Validate the JWT token received from the Algorand wallet to ensure its authenticity.
- Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks.
- Store sensitive information securely and use encryption where necessary.
- Keep your dependencies up to date to avoid security vulnerabilities.
- Use secure coding practices to prevent common security issues like SQL injection and XSS attacks.
- Monitor your application for security incidents and respond promptly to any threats.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the SIWA template, here are some common troubleshooting steps:

- Check the console for any error messages and debug information.
- Verify that the Algorand wallet app is installed and configured correctly on your mobile device.
- Ensure that your device is connected to the internet and can access the SIWA template.
- Clear your browser cache and cookies to resolve any caching issues.
- Restart the development server and try again.
